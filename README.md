# Hypermedia GraphQL RFC

This repository is dedicated to iterate on the idea of defining a Hypermedia GraphQL specification.

The basic idea is that all types that are defined as Resources can return actions.

A generic interface allows autonomous GraphQL clients to interact with Resources via actions.

Thanks to the type system of GraphQL, all this can be done in a type-safe manner.

the current state of the specification can be found in [spec.graphqls](spec.graphqls).
